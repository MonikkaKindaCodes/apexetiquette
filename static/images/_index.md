# Why use Hugo Books?

The Hugo Book theme is a lightweight and simple design. Creates a designated place where you can store documentation. Hugo Books is also compatible with the Netlify CMS, so you are able to deploy a site using a customized URL.

## Primary Goals of Maintaing Hugo

Contributions are welcome and I will review and consider pull requests.
Primary goals are:

- Keep it simple.

- Avoid using JS if it can be solved by CSS.
- Feel free to open issues if you find missing configuration or customisation options.
